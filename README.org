** Filter
   To filter log messages it is possible to use lua

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
   fblog -f 'level ~= "info"' # will print all message where the level is not info
   fblog -f 'process == "play"' # will print all message where the process is play
   fblog -f 'string.find(fu, "bow.*") ~= nil' # will print all messages where fu starts with bow
   fblog -f 'process == "play"' # will print all message where the process is play
   fblog -f 'process == "rust" and fu == "bower"'
   fblog --no-implicit-filter-return-statement -f 'if 3 > 2 then return true else return false end'
   #+END_SRC


** Customize
   ~fblog~ tries to detect the message, severity and timestamp of a log
   entry. This behavior can be customized. See ~--help~ for more
   information.

** Installation
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   cargo install fblog
   #+END_SRC
